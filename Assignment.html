		 <blockquote>
		 The design of the flag comes from the shield in the coat of arms of the Calvert family, the colonial proprietors of Maryland.  George Calvert, first Lord Baltimore, adopted a coat of arms that included a shield with alternating quadrants featuring the yellow-and-black colors of his paternal family and the red-and-white colors of his maternal family, the Crosslands.
